    <p>Jin or Kim Sokjin is the oldest member in the band of BTS he was born on December 4, 1992 in Gyeonggi-do, Gwacheon, South Korea. He is also the girliest member of the band. In fact hsi favorite color is pink and he actually adores the disney princesses (not that there is anything wrong with the disney princesses i honestly love them as well). Anyway back on topic he is also the best cook in BTS so he is like their eomma. Jin has said that if he was a girl he would date Jimin because Jin is really shy and Jimin would really help him open up to people and stop being so shy also Jimin is so tiny and like super adorable. Jin has said numerous times that his role model is T.O.P from the band Big Bang.  </p>

His role models are  </p>
