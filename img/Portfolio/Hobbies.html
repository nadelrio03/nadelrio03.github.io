    <p>Jin or Kim Sokjin is the oldest member in the band of BTS he was born on December 4, 1992 in Gyeonggi-do, Gwacheon, South Korea. He is also the girliest member of the band. In fact hsi favorite color is pink and he actually adores the disney princesses (not that there is anything wrong with the disney princesses i honestly love them as well). Anyway back on topic he is also the best cook in BTS so he is like their eomma. Jin has said that if he was a girl he would date Jimin because Jin is really shy and Jimin would really help him open up to people and stop being so shy also Jimin is so tiny and like super adorable. Jin has said numerous times that his role model is T.O.P from the band Big Bang.  </p>

    <p>Suga or Min Yoongi is the second oldest in the band he was born on March 9, 1993 in Buk-gu, Daegu, South Korea. He is like seriously the most chill and laid back person you have ever met and he is very hard working as well which explains why he is always so tired and sleepy (which i think is super adorable to be honest and so just undeniably cute). His hobbies are Doing nothing when he has free time, taking photos, and avoiding having to do work (talk about super lazy huh, if he was in an anime he would totally be Shikamaru from Naruto). He is known as the dad in the group becasue he is always stuck fixing the things that Rap Monster breaks. As i have explained before Suga loves to chill and do nothing on his days off and so becasue of that his nickname is motionless min. His role models are Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, Lil Wayne and Hit Boy. His stage name is suga because he looks so sweet when he smiles but really he's a little demon most times. When Min Yoongi was just a little boy he actually had dreams of becoming an architect but he sadly gave up on those dreams. When asked on a tv program what he would steal from the members he sadi that he would steal the thing that you can't buy with money - jungkook's age! LOL! Here are some things that the members think of him Jin: “He likes being attached to his bed. He has a variety of knowledge and always gives help with that knowledge. I’m fascinated as to where he gets that weird knowledge from.”  J-Hope: “Is cool. His personality is quite strong on his own thoughts. Pretends not to care when he does. Seems like he’s all over the place, but is quite careful. That kind of personality." V: “He really has a lot of knowledge. He’s quite cool on stage. Cool and amazing. No answer to him being lethargic.” Jeongguk: “He’s like a grandpa. But his passion towards music is overflooding. He also has a lot of knowledge. But he’s still a grandpa.” Rap Monster: “Lingers on things more than you would think. He’s really timid once you get to know him. Full of random information. Grandpa. Although he seems cool – never… no no… Wants to be loved. Likes music. Has passion and stubbornness. Says what he wants to and can say everything well in front. Has style.”  Jimin: “He talks too much in front of you. He doesn’t hesitate, and although this is my personal thoughts, he likes being loved by the members ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ”(Information from: http://kprofiles.com/suga-facts-profile/) </p>

    <p>J-Hope or Jung Hoseok is the third oldest in the band or the third youngest whatever you want to take it as anway he was born on February 18, 1994 in Gwangju. His role models are G-dragon of BIGBANG, A$AP Rock, J.Cole, and Beenzino (which i adore him for did i mention that he is my bias in the group and i love him so much like a lot. Seriously like i love him so much). His favorite color is green and he has a really long face which kind of reminds me of that one actress from Les Miserables and Princess Diaries. The members were all asked to describe him and Jungkook said that he was like a deer, Jimin said that he was like the 2nd grandma (i guess the first has to be yoongi then), Suga said he was like a cat, and Jin said that he was like a beagle puppy really messy and untidy at home and he is also very clingy just like a cute little beagle puppy.   </p>
