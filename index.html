        <h2 id="main">The Future</h2>
        <p id="main">I want to be a fashion designer one day and also an architect as well as an automobile designer,interior designer, or any type of designer really. I wanted to be a vet but sadly i am allergic to animal fur. I also want to travel the world one day because i just find it so fascinating how different people are and that's mainly the reason why i try so hard to learn many languages becuase i want to travel the world and explore it and meet people from very different backgrounds and lean how different yet how alike we are that's also the reason why i want to do my very best in school along with the fact that i want to give my parents the life that they always wanted and the life i know that they deserve.</p>
        <h2 id="main">After School</h2>
        <p id="main">
        I love to play sports like baseball, football, Tennis, and many other sports. I love kick-boxing and actually it is my second favorite sport (after baseball of course). I love to rap and can actually rap in many languages like russian, italian, hangugo, hindi, and chinese. I love to study and learn which people think is weird but i love it and it's the reason why i can do a lot of things and why i know lots of things but still i'm far from smart. I love to dance, sing, and listen to Kpop which i get teased for at home. I also love to play mortal kombat and street fighter and other games like HALO and many other fighting games.
