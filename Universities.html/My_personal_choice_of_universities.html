       <h3>Seoul National University</h3>
       <p>Seoul National University has been ranked #35 in the World University Ranking and it has been ranked #10 in the Asian University Ranking.</p>
       <h4>Why Choose SNU?</h4>

        <h4>Tuition</h4>

        </ol>
        <h4>Why I chose SNU</h4>
        <p>My first choice for university is Seoul National University. I chose this university because it has many majors that I am interested in exploring. For example I want to double major in Computer Science and Engineering as well as Business Administration but then that would be a triple major. I think that it would be very beneficial towards my future to study all three of those majors and get at least a master's degree on all of those majors because an employer would want somebody who can do many things not just one single thing. I actually really am aiming for a PH.D on all three of them but a masters is the minimum. As far as i know the future will consist mainly of computers and technology so if you know how to work on the computers and you know how technology works then you will have a way better life and a better job as well. I also very much love the location of this college because it is in the heart of South Korea and that is honestly my dream home plus it is very foreigner friendly.</p>

It is more well known for it's technology majors and for the sudents that come out successfull. The campus is very beautiful and modern as expected from a pristine private university and the proffessors are very well known and willing to help out the students. It is a pretty small college so that means that the student to professer ratio is beter than in most universities where proffessors are very overwhelmed with the amount of sudnets they teach. Although this is a very amazing and prisine University the price is very high and only the students with very rich parents can acually go to this pristine university.</p>
