    <div id="body"><p>Jin or Kim Sokjin is the oldest member in the band of BTS he was born on December 4, 1992 in Gyeonggi-do, Gwacheon, South Korea. He is also the girliest member of the band. In fact hsi favorite color is pink and he actually adores the disney princesses (not that there is anything wrong with the disney princesses i honestly love them as well). Anyway back on topic he is also the best cook in BTS so he is like their eomma. Jin's favorite items are his Maple Story action figures, Super Mario action figures, and Nintendo games. Jin has said that if he was a girl he would date Jimin because Jin is really shy and Jimin would really help him open up to people and stop being so shy also Jimin is so tiny and like super adorable. Jin has said numerous times that his role model is T.O.P from the band Big Bang. Jin is friends with Kidoh (Jin Hyosang) of ToppDogg. Kidoh (He is one of my biases from toppDogg becasue he's just so cute and adorable) left Big Hit Entertainment in 2012 and switched to Stardom Entertainment. Jin said once that if he has a day off he would wantt Suga as a servant so that he could boss him around (honestly what is with these members being mean to my bias like seriously wth!). Jin is really weird in my opinion like he said that he likes strawberries but he doesn't like strawberry flavored things but then i guess that makes sense since i also hate artificial strawberry flavors but i also adore strawberries. What the other members think of him Jungkook: “Jin-hyung looks manly and he’s chic like a wolf but personality-wise, he’s carefree so he’s sloth-like (laughs). He’s really nice and he’s also a good cook, so we call him “granny” between us.” Jimin: “He’s the oldest, but he likes to whine.” [After School Club] Jimin: “He’s like a grandma.” Suga: “A Wolf.” V: “Prince.” J-Hope: “A Princess.” Jin and Jimin always go to the Gym together. That is so cute i would've thought that Jin isn't really the type of boy to be working out at the gym but more or less the type of boy that stays home and reads a book or something like that but then again out of all of BTS he was voted as the member with the best body.  Jin, “I’m in charge of the kitchen. When we come back from grocery shopping, the members just dump the stuff we bought anywhere and don’t put it in the fridge. So I put in all the food in the fridge and throw out old food. (laughs) This is basically why he is called the eomma of the group so cute though. Suga, “He’s a family man. He’s an ideal husband! (laughs)” LOl suga stills says that about him even though Jin is always talking about how he wants suga to be his servant. Jin’s Resolution for 2014 was that he wanted to try getting muscles/abs. He think it’ll be good to try it once. He thought that if he gets them it’ll be good. When Jin went to the practice room and spotted a new friend ( V ). V suddenly came over to Jin and started dancing while rubbing V body on Jin. But with his flat face, he just said, “You, go dance in the front over there” to V. LOL i could just imagine jin as the main character from "One Punch Man" lol that would be so funny to see. Suga, “Hope-y and I were awake together but we were tired so we were about to sleep when Jin hyung started singing “좋아요” (Like). (laughs) I thought we must practice really hard [for him to even sing in his sleep]. Turns out, it was just him talking in his sleep. After that I thought, “Ah. That hyung practices even in his sleep. Of course.” That is so cute but sad like does he really practice that hard that now he even practices in his sleep as well!? Jin wants his firstborn child to be a daughter, second to be a son. He wants to make a noona for his son. Jin wants his son to have a noona because a noona would give him pocket money. He said that his hyung always took his money. Jin thought of a restaurant he want to visit. He want to ask his mom to eat there [with him]. Because he think life is about food.

    <div id="body"><p>Suga or Min Yoongi is the second oldest in the band he was born on March 9, 1993 in Buk-gu, Daegu, South Korea. He is like seriously the most chill and laid back person you have ever met and he is very hard working as well which explains why he is always so tired and sleepy (which i think is super adorable to be honest and so just undeniably cute). His hobbies are Doing nothing when he has free time, taking photos, and avoiding having to do work (talk about super lazy huh, if he was in an anime he would totally be Shikamaru from Naruto). He is known as the dad in the group becasue he is always stuck fixing the things that Rap Monster breaks. As i have explained before Suga loves to chill and do nothing on his days off and so becasue of that his nickname is motionless min. His role models are Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, Lil Wayne and Hit Boy. His stage name is suga because he looks so sweet when he smiles but really he's a little demon most times. When Min Yoongi was just a little boy he actually had dreams of becoming an architect but he sadly gave up on those dreams. When asked on a tv program what he would steal from the members he sadi that he would steal the thing that you can't buy with money - jungkook's age! LOL! Here are some things that the members think of him Jin: “He likes being attached to his bed. He has a variety of knowledge and always gives help with that knowledge. I’m fascinated as to where he gets that weird knowledge from.”  J-Hope: “Is cool. His personality is quite strong on his own thoughts. Pretends not to care when he does. Seems like he’s all over the place, but is quite careful. That kind of personality." V: “He really has a lot of knowledge. He’s quite cool on stage. Cool and amazing. No answer to him being lethargic.” Jeongguk: “He’s like a grandpa. But his passion towards music is overflooding. He also has a lot of knowledge. But he’s still a grandpa.” Rap Monster: “Lingers on things more than you would think. He’s really timid once you get to know him. Full of random information. Grandpa. Although he seems cool – never… no no… Wants to be loved. Likes music. Has passion and stubbornness. Says what he wants to and can say everything well in front. Has style.”  Jimin: “He talks too much in front of you. He doesn’t hesitate, and although this is my personal thoughts, he likes being loved by the members ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ”(Information from: http://kprofiles.com/suga-facts-profile/) Suga is honestly one of the best composers that i know and he actually wrote one of my favorite songs titled "like it" in under 40 minutes (It is seriously an amazing song, however has a lot of swearing but besides ha tit is a very good song). Suga has attended Global Cyber University and his major is broadcasting performing art. He has won many awards such as MelOn Music Award : New artist of the year(2013) Golden Disk Award: Newcomer Award(2014) MelOn Music Award: Best Male Dance Award(2015) Golden Disk Award: Disk Bongsang (2016) which is really impressive considering the band has only been active since 2013. Yoongi-si is honestly really scary to me sometimes since he looks just like a cute porcelain doll with his perfect pale skin and pretty sleepy eyes and his smile which is sweet as sugar. so yeha he's really scary especially when he dressed up as chucky for halloween, he was like so cute but just so creepy at the same time. He is good at all kinds of sports which is surprising if you consider the fact that he loves to be really lazy, however the members have all voted on him to be the most active in the band. I love him because he is kind of like me i guess,  he is a typical craftman type person and he does not want others to bother him while he does his own things, which is basically what i do all the time both at home and at school as well. Suga loves Basketball.  When he was in school, he won basketball games quite a few times, and when he was a trainee, he played basketball every Sunday. He was scouted for a team with some college students at the Han River, but since he debuted, he didn’t have time. His position was usually point guard or shooting guard. He’s quick on his feet, and he’s better at defense than offense. (information thanks to http://miner8.com/en/20992)</p></div>

    <div id="body"><p>J-Hope or Jung Hoseok is the third oldest in the band or the third youngest whatever you want to take it as anway he was born on February 18, 1994 in Gwangju. His role models are G-dragon of BIGBANG, A$AP Rock, J.Cole, and Beenzino (which i adore him for did i mention that he is my bias in the group and i love him so much like a lot. Seriously like i love him so much). His favorite color is green and he has a really long face which kind of reminds me of that one actress from Les Miserables and Princess Diaries. The members were all asked to describe him and Jungkook said that he was like a deer, Jimin said that he was like the 2nd grandma (i guess the first has to be yoongi then), Suga said he was like a cat, and Jin said that he was like a beagle puppy really messy and untidy at home and he is also very clingy just like a cute little beagle puppy. J-Hope was actually the rapper in 2AM‘s JoKwon‘s “Animal“ which is so amazing especially if you think about how popuklar JoKwon is. J-Hope was actually part of an underground dance group and he did a lot of popping and like b-boy type dances. He actually won a lot of awards thanks to that and he is actually the best dancer in the group in my opinion anyway an dhe is also relaly good at imitating girl group dances. when asked what things he wants to steal from other members he said Jimin’s chocolate abs, Rap Monster’s rap skill and his good English which i guess is reasonable since everyone loves Jimin's chocolate bar abs and english is actually a very useful thing to know. Here are some things that the members think of him Suga: “I’m not good at expressing how i feel with words.But Jimin and J-Hope are good at expressing themselves.I envy them for that.” Rap Monster: “There’s something he always says whenever we make a comeback or wrap up our promotion. He says that we got to make a comeback or successfull complete the promotion, thanks to the love shown by our fans.” Jimin’s first impression about J-Hope: “The first person i met was J-Hope. He was very friendly to me, ‘Excuse me, Jimin..’. So i remembered J-Hope the most.” Jimin about J-Hope’s mean side: “J-Hope is bright guy, laugh a lot and has become hopeful like his name. J-Hope has good energy that effects everyone in a good way and i think J-hope is awesome. And people think he’s always nice and innocent. But, inside his smiley face, there’s an evil living there. J-Hope winds me up all the time but never stop smiling even when he does that. But you can never punch someone who looks so happy like that. One day, i was sleeping and all of sudden he poked me and shook me saying,‘Jiiiimiiiiiiiin, wake up and play with me!!!!’So, i woke up. But right after i opened my eyes, he just grinned at me and went back to sleep like nothing happened. So i thought,‘Uuuugh! i can never say anything to him cause he’s older than me!’.And once he told me he would give me a massage and started squeezing the back of my neck, and that got tigher and tigher! He was smiling at then too! At the end i wat getting upset but he didn’t stop it. He was doing it even harder and said,‘This will relax your muscles.’When i was sitting down at the rehearsal room during the break, he head locked me. He hit me once and left the room so i looked at him with a serious face for a second. J-Hope, the timid, came to the room only after three seconds and gave me some mischievous hugs and said,‘Jimin! Are you upset at me? Are you?? You are not! Aren’t you??’Chuckling hard, he left room after 10 seconds. What should i do with him?” (most of this information is all thanks to http://kprofiles.com/j-hope-facts-profile/)</p> </div>

    <div id="body"><p>Rap Monster also known as Kim Namjoon was born on September 12, 1994 in Ilsan, Gyeonggi-d. His favorite color is black i was totally surprised when i learned that becasue i thought his favorite color was going to be red or something cool like that. Rap Monster is the leader of the band despite him being the third oldest or third youngest. He taught himself how to speak english and is actually a really good english speaker now and even has the american accent and i think personally that he has some traits that would be categorized as "american" for example he has like really big lips in my opinion. Rap Monster is also super smart and he has an IQ of 148. He was previously ranked in the top 1% of the nation in his high school exams and he also studied in New Zealand. Rap Monster is like Suga's partner since they both work on composing songs and Rap Monster alone has composed over 100 songs. Rap Mon’s role model is Kanye West and A$AP Rocky (I'm starting to notice a pattern between all of the rappers like mostt of them look up to A$AP Rocky). Here are some things that the members think of him Suga: “On the stage, Rap Mon wears sunglasess and has a powerful image but actually he likes cute things. He keeps the ‘Pocket Monster Ball’ on his bed that he received at a fansign.” Jin: “The Baby Dinosaur Dolly. He shakes his tail an crushes things.” Jimin: ” In the fact, he gets hurt easily.”  Rap Monster, “If I’m fire, J-Hope is water. he’s good at ‘turning off’ my bad habits. He’s really sociable so he’s good at mixing with others and our group members.” That i slike so adorable how he relies on j-hope to keep him at bay it's just so....awww. He choose J-Hope for dating if he was a girl, because J-Hope is like the mother in the dorm. Rapmon said Rapping was an escape from his stress. He received from studying. He used to study extremely hard. Truthfully, this connects with the lyrics of “No More Dream” – when he was studying, he had no dreams. He had a possible path because he was good at studying. He didn’t specifically have something that he wanted to do. So while promoting as Bangtan, he sending his past self a message.  Rap Monster Ideal Date —> “It’s like the ordinary college student date. We can see a movie together, eating together, walking together. I want to have love like that. It’s because i can’t at all. (Laugh)” That's so sweet but it's so sad becuase he wants to have a date that most people get during their lifetime like with the movies and everything but then he just says oh wait i totally can't do that because anywhere i go everybody is gonna be all over me and they won't let us have our date in peace. Rap Mon said that he and GOT7 Jackson are good friends, and said Jackson is very handsome and really good at dancing. Then he said that Jackson is very social, and one time he went up to BTS’s stylist and told her, “I’m close with Rap Mon.” And offered her chocolate. [Park Seo Hyun ‘Love Game’ Radio] I can literally just imagine that of course jackson would do that he's the only idiot i know of that would do something as dumb as that lol but it sounds so adorable at the same time. Rap Mon was studying in Engineering Department before debut. This is why i also love rap monster because he inspires me and makes me want to go to college and study what i want because one day i want to be as awesome as him well actually i think that i look up to all hte kpop idols because they had to work so hard for everything that they have now but yet they still work even harder to be even better than they are right now, that is why i love kpop so much because they work so hard to be their best and to get even higher (metaphorically) than they are right now.

    <div id="body"><p>Jimin also known as Park Jimin, is the third youngest or fifth oldest whatever the heck you want to think of it as. Anyway whatever Jimin was born on October 13,1995 in Busan, South Korea which is so beautiful honestly it can totally rival Seoul, South Korea and that is like one of the most beautiful cities in my opinion. Jimin's favorite color is Blue which is a really nice color but personally i think that red is way better. Jimin is Taeyang's biggest fanboy which is so funny because most of the members in this band are all huge fanboys of at least one member in Big Bang. Jimin is adddicted to practicing and because of that addiction he only sleeps 3 hours a day which is crazy like seriously why the heck would he even do that?! Jimin danced popping since 8th grade and gained interest in this kind of career after watching Rain performances.  Jimin's role models are Rain, Taeyang from Bigbang and Chris Brown (This is why i adore jimin so much honestly who doesn't love chris brown he's so hot and one of the only american postars i know about that actually dances and doesn't just stand around. What the other members think of him: Jin, “Comes at you really cutely. It’s like being attacked by a puppy. Can’t refuse requests because he’s too nice.”  Rap Monster, “Basically kind and gentle. Is very considerate. Isn’t as timid as you would think. Likes clothes and style (same with me). But even though he responds well, there are many times where he doesn’t actually do it. Is quite stubborn. Is the effort-type.” Suga, “Follows the hyungs’ words well, isn’t the personality where he’ll receive dislike somewhere, puts in effort to live his hardest” J-Hope, who is the best looking in the universe (J-Hope wrote this) : “Is kind, listens to his hyungs well, has a lot of greed, and has a personality where he makes sure to do his part, and he has a really good personality where he likes me the most and his faith towards me is very strong~~ ♥♥♥♥” Jeongguk, “He’s the effort-type along with being a triple blood-type A, timid, shameless, and hates losing.” V, “Cute. Only the amount of him losing his temper is excessive, he’s kind and a friend that’s trustworthy. I talk to him the most, and if I have any worries, he’s the friend that I tell it first to.”  Jimin to himself : ” He’s timid ㅋㅋㅋ Has a personality where he hates losing. Has a bright personality and likes to smile. Feels competitive with the members and is the type to complain a lot about himself. There are times where he loses his temper and really likes cute things.” Jimin resolution —> “My aim is frankly to be the first. This has many meanings but i want to get the first place in music program and i also want to get really important award at some award ceremony.”  Jimin, ” Of course. It was my first- ever audition so my hands were shaking a lot when I opened the door. I also remember that my voice shook a lot while singing. But because I started dancing at a young age, I danced very confidently.” Somehow i fel like Jimin is actually very self concious despite always saying that he's super hot and everything but if you just think about it he knows way too much about skin care products plus he's always practicing and trying t be better that just screams that he isn't really happy with himself right now. But why he's cute, famous, and everybody loves him so why is he so sef concious.( most information thanks to: https://btsdiary.com/facts/jimin/ ) </p></div>

    <div id="body"><p>V or Kim Taehyung was born on December 30, 1995. Habits : Biting his nails,opening his mouth, touching anything that’s cute, and saying ‘Eomma!” (Mom?) and “It hurts!” a lot. Jimin said V is sometimes worse than the maknae which i would have to agree on since sometimes he does act way too childish but i think that's what makes him so fun and awesome to be around like why would i want to hang out with a dude that never wants to play around and have fun like go to a park or a carnival and just let loose and act like children again. Honestly that's the type of dude i love most because they are the funnest to hang out with. V's favourite colours are Black, white, and green. V likes almost all of the cartoons on Tooniverse and he watched most of them. I think i might have to disagree with Suga and say that V would be the best husband because he's so fun and he loves cartoons too so if you have children he would be hte best person to take care of the kids. What the members think of him: Jimin,  “Sometimes he’s worse than the maknae. (laughs) It’s fascinating.” Suga, “Everyone says this but people with blood type AB are either a complete genius or a complete idiot. He’s both. But sometimes he comes up with really good ideas and surprises us.” Suga, “At first, i thought his (unique) behavior was all made up. I mean, how can a man like that exist in the world? I really thought he was acting. I was wrong, though. He exists. He’s a really unusual guy. I’ve never seen someone like him before. (V Who came from the stars). He doesn’t seem normal.” [Skool Luv Affair Keyword Talk] Rap Monster, “In my opinion, he’s 10% genius and 90% idiot (laughs).” Jungkook, “V-Hyung hates losing to others. He used to play the saxophone but started the guitar after seeing me play it.”  Jimin, “I’ve seen V playing a dual role during his laundry (lifting the weariness of chores with monodrama). He gathers the clothes talking to himself.” [Skool Luv Affair Keyword Talk]V : Hey Sis, come here! (Man version). Why? (Girl Version). Just come here (Man). Why are you doing this to me? (Girl). Coz i like you (Man). [He acting a laundry master]V : I was bored. There was nearly no one in our residence. V played Saxophone for 3 years since 7th grade and then stopped in this fourth year, so he hasn’t improved. He once received an award after playing Desperado (by the Eagles) on the saxophone. Woah that's so awesome he really is taented ha and Rap mon said that he was 90% idiot lol. V, “I hadn’t gotten permission from my parents so I wasn’t planning on doing a private audition. I was only thinking about looking around the Academy. I went to look around but ran into one of the rookie group development Noonas. She told me to try auditioning, called my parents, got permission, and I auditioned. When I checked later, I was the only one from Daegu to pass the auditions. It was a sudden audition but I thought, “Yay. Let’s do it!” and wasn’t nervous at all. (laughs)” V, “My stage name was chosen last. Six, Lex, V. Those three names were suggested but the members and PD all said that V fit me the best and so I picked V to stand for victory.” He watch all episode of anime such as Digimon Adventure, Wolf Children, and The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, One Pice, Summer Wars, Piano No Mori, and other works of Director Hosada Mamoru. I think that I might be in love right now somebody catch me becasue i think i'm falling for this idiot. His role model is his Dad. He wants to be a dad like his dad, someone who takes care of his children, listen to everything they say, encourage and advise the future plans well and get the scolded by their wife a lot. LOL that is so cute but does he really want to get scolded by his wife! (information thanks to: https://btsdiary.com/facts/v/) </p></div>

    <div id="body"><p>Jungkook or Jeon Jungkook was born on September 1, 1997 in Buk district, Busan, South Korea. His favorite colors are red, black and white. Those are also my favorite colors but i think that out of all of the band members he is my least favorite i don't know why but he just is for some weird reason. In ten years he wants to either be the owner of a duck meat restaurant or a tattoo artist which confuses me so much because i feel like it would be so weird to go from a kpop idol to a duck meat restaurant owner. Jungkook looks up to G-dragon from Big Bang of course it would be a member from Big Bang because all of them look up to at least one person form that band.  Jungkook, “In 7th grade, I had dreams of becoming a singer after listening to G-Dragon sunbaenim’s songs. Then in 8th grade, I got casted by Big Hit after leaving the Superstar K3 auditions and became a part of Bangtan.” His favorite items are his shoes and his makeup of course. Jungkook says that he wants his japanese fans to call him Kkukie or Golden Maknae he is also considered the devil maknae. I totally disagree with that though because the only devil maknae there is and ever will be is Kyuhyun-si because he is the original devil maknae and he literally could be the devil most times. Jungkook Favourite song is Zion T Feat Primary ‘See Through’. The artist's that have influenced him are Supreme Team, G-Dragon, and Macklemore. He once cried when he couldn't sing a song correctly. Whenever he is sad or worried, he always goes to rap monster for advice because he is always the first to notice if something is wrong with him. </p></div>
