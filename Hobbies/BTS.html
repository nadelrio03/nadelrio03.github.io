    <p>Jin or Kim Sokjin is the oldest member in the band of BTS he was born on December 4, 1992 in Gyeonggi-do, Gwacheon, South Korea. He is also the girliest member of the band. In fact hsi favorite color is pink and he actually adores the disney princesses (not that there is anything wrong with the disney princesses i honestly love them as well). Anyway back on topic he is also the best cook in BTS so he is like their eomma. Jin has said that if he was a girl he would date Jimin because Jin is really shy and Jimin would really help him open up to people and stop being so shy also Jimin is so tiny and like super adorable. Jin has said numerous times that his role model is T.O.P from the band Big Bang. Jin is friends with Kidoh (Jin Hyosang) of ToppDogg. Kidoh (He is one of my biases from toppDogg becasue he's just so cute and adorable) left Big Hit Entertainment in 2012 and switched to Stardom Entertainment. Jin said once that if he has a day off he would wantt Suga as a servant so that he could boss him around (honestly what is with these members being mean to my bias like seriously wth!). Jin is really weird in my opinion like he said that he likes strawberries but he doesn't like strawberry flavored things but then i guess that makes sense since i also hate artificial strawberry flavors but i also adore strawberries. What the other members think of him Jungkook: “Jin-hyung looks manly and he’s chic like a wolf but personality-wise, he’s carefree so he’s sloth-like (laughs). He’s really nice and he’s also a good cook, so we call him “granny” between us.” Jimin: “He’s the oldest, but he likes to whine.” [After School Club] Jimin: “He’s like a grandma.” Suga: “A Wolf.” V: “Prince.” J-Hope: “A Princess.” (most of the information on this is all thanks to http://kprofiles.com/jin-facts-profile/)</p>

    <p>Suga or Min Yoongi is the second oldest in the band he was born on March 9, 1993 in Buk-gu, Daegu, South Korea. He is like seriously the most chill and laid back person you have ever met and he is very hard working as well which explains why he is always so tired and sleepy (which i think is super adorable to be honest and so just undeniably cute). His hobbies are Doing nothing when he has free time, taking photos, and avoiding having to do work (talk about super lazy huh, if he was in an anime he would totally be Shikamaru from Naruto). He is known as the dad in the group becasue he is always stuck fixing the things that Rap Monster breaks. As i have explained before Suga loves to chill and do nothing on his days off and so becasue of that his nickname is motionless min. His role models are Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, Lil Wayne and Hit Boy. His stage name is suga because he looks so sweet when he smiles but really he's a little demon most times. When Min Yoongi was just a little boy he actually had dreams of becoming an architect but he sadly gave up on those dreams. When asked on a tv program what he would steal from the members he sadi that he would steal the thing that you can't buy with money - jungkook's age! LOL! Here are some things that the members think of him Jin: “He likes being attached to his bed. He has a variety of knowledge and always gives help with that knowledge. I’m fascinated as to where he gets that weird knowledge from.”  J-Hope: “Is cool. His personality is quite strong on his own thoughts. Pretends not to care when he does. Seems like he’s all over the place, but is quite careful. That kind of personality." V: “He really has a lot of knowledge. He’s quite cool on stage. Cool and amazing. No answer to him being lethargic.” Jeongguk: “He’s like a grandpa. But his passion towards music is overflooding. He also has a lot of knowledge. But he’s still a grandpa.” Rap Monster: “Lingers on things more than you would think. He’s really timid once you get to know him. Full of random information. Grandpa. Although he seems cool – never… no no… Wants to be loved. Likes music. Has passion and stubbornness. Says what he wants to and can say everything well in front. Has style.”  Jimin: “He talks too much in front of you. He doesn’t hesitate, and although this is my personal thoughts, he likes being loved by the members ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ”(Information from: http://kprofiles.com/suga-facts-profile/) </p>

    <p>J-Hope or Jung Hoseok is the third oldest in the band or the third youngest whatever you want to take it as anway he was born on February 18, 1994 in Gwangju. His role models are G-dragon of BIGBANG, A$AP Rock, J.Cole, and Beenzino (which i adore him for did i mention that he is my bias in the group and i love him so much like a lot. Seriously like i love him so much). His favorite color is green and he has a really long face which kind of reminds me of that one actress from Les Miserables and Princess Diaries. The members were all asked to describe him and Jungkook said that he was like a deer, Jimin said that he was like the 2nd grandma (i guess the first has to be yoongi then), Suga said he was like a cat, and Jin said that he was like a beagle puppy really messy and untidy at home and he is also very clingy just like a cute little beagle puppy. J-Hope was actually the rapper in 2AM‘s JoKwon‘s “Animal“ which is so amazing especially if you think about how popuklar JoKwon is. J-Hope was actually part of an underground dance group and he did a lot of popping and like b-boy type dances. He actually won a lot of awards thanks to that and he is actually the best dancer in the group in my opinion anyway an dhe is also relaly good at imitating girl group dances. when asked what things he wants to steal from other members he said Jimin’s chocolate abs, Rap Monster’s rap skill and his good English which i guess is reasonable since everyone loves Jimin's chocolate bar abs and english is actually a very useful thing to know. Here are some things that the members think of him Suga: “I’m not good at expressing how i feel with words.But Jimin and J-Hope are good at expressing themselves.I envy them for that.” Rap Monster: “There’s something he always says whenever we make a comeback or wrap up our promotion. He says that we got to make a comeback or successfull complete the promotion, thanks to the love shown by our fans.” Jimin’s first impression about J-Hope: “The first person i met was J-Hope. He was very friendly to me, ‘Excuse me, Jimin..’. So i remembered J-Hope the most.” Jimin about J-Hope’s mean side: “J-Hope is bright guy, laugh a lot and has become hopeful like his name. J-Hope has good energy that effects everyone in a good way and i think J-hope is awesome. And people think he’s always nice and innocent. But, inside his smiley face, there’s an evil living there. J-Hope winds me up all the time but never stop smiling even when he does that. But you can never punch someone who looks so happy like that. One day, i was sleeping and all of sudden he poked me and shook me saying,‘Jiiiimiiiiiiiin, wake up and play with me!!!!’So, i woke up. But right after i opened my eyes, he just grinned at me and went back to sleep like nothing happened. So i thought,‘Uuuugh! i can never say anything to him cause he’s older than me!’.And once he told me he would give me a massage and started squeezing the back of my neck, and that got tigher and tigher! He was smiling at then too! At the end i wat getting upset but he didn’t stop it. He was doing it even harder and said,‘This will relax your muscles.’When i was sitting down at the rehearsal room during the break, he head locked me. He hit me once and left the room so i looked at him with a serious face for a second. J-Hope, the timid, came to the room only after three seconds and gave me some mischievous hugs and said,‘Jimin! Are you upset at me? Are you?? You are not! Aren’t you??’Chuckling hard, he left room after 10 seconds. What should i do with him?”</p>

    <p>Rap Monster was born on September 12, 1994 in Ilsan, Gyeonggi-d. Rap Monster is the leader of the band despite him being the third oldest or third youngest. He taught himself how to speak english and is actually a really good english speaker now and even has the american accent and i think personally that he has some traits that would be categorized as "american" for example he has like really big lips in my opinion. Rap Monster is also super smart and he has an IQ of 148. He was previously ranked in the top 1% of the nation in his high school exams and he also studied in New Zealand. Rap Monster is like Suga's partner since they both work on composing songs and Rap Monster alone has composed over 100 songs. Rap Mon’s role model is Kanye West and A$AP Rocky (I'm starting to notice a pattern between all of the rappers like mostt of them look up to A$AP Rocky). Here are some things that the members think of him Suga: “On the stage, Rap Mon wears sunglasess and has a powerful image but actually he likes cute things. He keeps the ‘Pocket Monster Ball’ on his bed that he received at a fansign.” Jin: “The Baby Dinosaur Dolly. He shakes his tail an crushes things.” Jimin: ” In the fact, he gets hurt easily.” (most information from http://kprofiles.com/bts-bangtan-boys-members-profile/) </p>

    <p>Jimin also known as Park Jimin, is the third youngest or fifth oldest whatever the heck you want to think of it as. Anyway whatever Jimin was born on October 13,1995 in Busan, South Korea which is so beautiful honestly it can totally rival Seoul, South Korea and that is like one of the most beautiful cities in my opinion.   </p>
